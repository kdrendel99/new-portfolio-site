                Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ 
                <br />
                <br />
                I'm Karl, a full-stack software engineer with a passion for crafting code and creating meaningful digital experiences. Over the past 3+ years, I've immersed myself in the dynamic world of software engineering, honing my skills and pushing boundaries.
                <br />
                <br />

                In my most recent adventure at Covey.IO, I had the incredible opportunity to contribute to the financial technology industry. Starting as a front-end engineer, I quickly moved up the ranks to become the Lead Software Engineer for Covey.IO's flagship product, 'Training Club' â€“ a web-based mock portfolio builder. Not to brag (well, maybe just a little), but I turbocharged users' financial performance data charts by a whopping 500%. Beyond that, I played a pivotal role in building client-facing systems for Ethereum blockchain transactions, automated monthly crypto payouts, and executed a site-wide facelift based on Figma mock-ups. Talk about a tech makeover!
                <br />
                <br />
                My journey into the tech realm kicked off with a Software Engineering Internship at Ascend Software LLC, where I delved into AI-driven accounts payable automation for medium to large enterprises. Before that, I dedicated time to Epicodus as a Software Engineering Tutor, helping aspiring developers troubleshoot and optimize web applications.
                <br />
                <br />
                Now, let's rewind a bit. Back at Clark College, I earned my AA degree in Graphic Design, where I not only immersed myself in the arts but also led photography special projects courses. However, my heart truly found its rhythm during my time at Epicodus' coding boot camp. There, I earned a Certificate in Full Stack Web and Mobile Development, engaging in 2,000+ hours of learning, problem-solving, and collaborative programming. The cherry on top? Winning the Best Interface Design award for my capstone project.
                {/* Yeah, I'm still beaming about that one. */}
                <br />
                <br />
                When I'm not pushing code, you'll likely find me scaling rock walls, jamming out as a musician, or capturing moments through the lens as a photographer and artist. These passions fuel my creativity and bring a unique flavor to my work.
                <br />
                <br />
                So, if you're looking for a tech enthusiast with a knack for turning challenges into triumphs, you're in the right place. Let's build something amazing together!
